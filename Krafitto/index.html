<h2 class="mb-4">Structure</h2>
            <h4> Level 1 </h4>(Team Krafitto —— interacting with schools and on some occasions 		      
                               with parents) <br>
                               ⬇<br>
                               ⬇<br>
                  <h4>  Level 2 </h4>(Preschool resources person —— bridge between Krafitto and parents)
                              <br> ⬇<br>
                               ⬇<br>
               <h4>Level 3 </h4>(Kids and parents — interacting with school and on some occasions 
                              with Krafitto) </p>
            <p class="mb-0">The whole programs works on a collaborative model where in schools have to drive the program at level 2 ensuring kids and parents both participate to make the program a grand success for school. Krafitto on regular basis will conduct online quiz and competitions which will help us to understand schools involvement in driving the program for their school. Schools will be given points every week on following basis -
            <li class="mb-0">Maximum number of student participation </li>
            <li class="mb-0">Maximum involvement of the students </li>
            <li class="mb-0">School management’s active involvement</li></p>
            <p class="mb-0">Although it’s a free program but Krafitto expects schools to take full advantage of it by actively participating in the program. Schools which are found to be least interest and are part of program only for the free resource material will be politely asked to leave the program. </p><br>
            <p class="mb-0">
            Krafitto, on most of the occasions will consider school as the only channel to deliver resources material to kids and parents hence school becomes an integral part of the program. In some cases parents will be asked to download our partner company apps or platforms for using the content.</p><br>
            <p class="mb-0">
            NOTE - Krafitto or Kraf Venture partnered apps or platforms will provide content for a limited time access after that if parents wish to buy the content, they will be redirected to our partner apps and platforms. Krafitto or Kraf Ventures pledge not to earn money from any of its alliance partners when parents buy any of their product and hence will never favour any commissions to schools. </p>
