<h2 class="mb-0 justify-content-center mb-4">Structure</h2>
            <h4> Level 1 </h4>(Team Krafitto —— interacting with schools and on some occasions 		      
                               with parents) <br>
                               ⬇<br>

            <p class="mb-0">
            Krafitto, on most of the occasions will consider school as the only channel to deliver resources material to kids and parents hence school becomes an integral part of the program. In some cases parents will be asked to download our partner company apps or platforms for using the content.</p><br>
            <p class="mb-0">
            NOTE - Krafitto or Kraf Venture partnered apps or platforms will provide content for a limited time access after that if parents wish to buy the content, they will be redirected to our partner apps and platforms. Krafitto or Kraf Ventures pledge not to earn money from any of its alliance partners when parents buy any of their product and hence will never favour any commissions to schools. </p><br>
